--1. What range of years does the database cover?
/*Final answer: The database covers the years 1871-2016, 146 years. The exceptions to this are the following tables:
		people - birth years range from 1820 to 1996 (176 years total with 166 year in database as having someone born in that year)
		collegeplaying - 1864 to 2014 (151 years)
	However, we clarified that the intent was to ask what years of professional baseball are in the database so the answer is 146 years (1871-2016).*/

--initial exploratory approach (repeat for each table with years), got differing ranges.
/* select distinct yearid
from teams
order by yearid;*/

--combine results from initial approach into a single table
SELECT DISTINCT teams.yearid AS teams_year, salaries.yearid as salaries_year, homegames.year as homegames_year, allstarfull.yearid as allstarfull_year, 
	   appearances.yearid as appearances_year, awardsmanagers.yearid as awardsmanager_year, awardsplayers.yearid as awardsplayers_year

--tried running code at this point and it takes too long.

--New approach: data dictionary says the database covers the years 1871-2016. Confirmed by running simple sueries on main tables.

8. Using the attendance figures from the homegames table, find the teams and parks which had the top 5 average attendance per game in 2016
